          Welcome to PCS Burger Bar — where bold flavors, fresh ingredients, and
          hometown comfort come together in every bite.
        
          We started with a simple goal: to bring the flavors we grew up loving
          to the heart of New Jersey. Inspired by backyard cookouts, road-trip
          diners, and the unbeatable taste of a classic American burger, PCS
          Burger Bar is more than just a restaurant — it’s a place where food
          brings people together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our burgers are handcrafted daily using premium cuts of beef, seasoned
          just right, and grilled to juicy perfection. Each one is stacked with
          fresh toppings, melty cheese, and our signature house-made sauces —
          all served on warm, toasted buns. Whether you like your burger
          classic, spicy, cheesy, or fully loaded, we’ve got a favorite waiting
          for you.
        </p>
       
          But we’re more than just burgers. Our hand-cut fries are golden and
          crispy, tossed in bold seasonings, and perfect for sharing (or not!).
          Wash it all down with an ice-cold soda, or grab one of our rotating
          specials for something new.
